# **Financial Market Analysis**  

This project uses **MySQL** to analyze financial market data, helping uncover **stock trends, trading patterns, and market sentiment**. The SQL code processes stock prices, trading volumes, and technical indicators to identify **market movements, risk factors, and potential trading opportunities**.  

## **What This SQL Code Does**  

### **1️⃣ Tracking Stock Price Trends**  
The SQL queries analyze **historical stock price data** to identify trends such as:  
📈 **Moving Averages** – Used to smooth out price fluctuations and reveal long-term trends  
📉 **Bollinger Bands** – Helps determine overbought or oversold conditions  
📊 **MACD & RSI Indicators** – Identifies momentum shifts and potential trend reversals  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Window Functions (OVER, LAG), Aggregations, Self-Joins*  

---  

### **2️⃣ Analyzing Market Volume and Liquidity**  
Stock trading volume is key in understanding **market activity**. The SQL queries help identify:  
- Days with unusually high or low trading activity  
- How volume correlates with price changes  
- Market liquidity patterns over time  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Aggregations, Time Series Analysis*  

---  

### **3️⃣ Recognizing Trading Patterns**  
The SQL code includes **pattern recognition techniques** that analyze historical price data to:  
- Detect **support and resistance levels**  
- Identify **breakout points**  
- Recognize **common chart patterns** like head-and-shoulders or triangles  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Recursive CTEs, Pattern Matching, Ranking Functions*  

---  

### **4️⃣ Understanding Market Sentiment**  
By analyzing external factors such as **news and social media**, the queries evaluate:  
- How sentiment affects stock prices  
- Whether **news volume** correlates with stock movements  
- Market trends based on **social media activity**  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Text Processing, Sentiment Scoring, Correlation Analysis*  

---  

### **5️⃣ Measuring Risk and Performance**  
The SQL code also calculates **risk metrics** to help assess potential gains and losses:  
⚠️ **Volatility & Drawdown Analysis** – Determines how risky a stock is  
📊 **Sharpe Ratio Calculation** – Measures risk-adjusted returns  
📈 **Portfolio Performance Metrics** – Evaluates overall investment performance  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Statistical Functions, Custom Stored Procedures, Performance Optimization (Indexing, Partitioning)*  

---  

## **How This SQL Code is Optimized for Performance**  
Since financial data can be **huge and complex**, the project includes **performance enhancements**:  
✅ **Indexes & Partitioning** – Speed up searches on large datasets  
✅ **Materialized Views** – Store frequently accessed calculations  
✅ **Efficient Joins & Recursive Queries** – Avoid slow and redundant computations
